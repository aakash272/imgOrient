This app manipulates image orientations to provide for the 4 most basic and commonly used image effects like flip vertically or horizontally and rotate 90 degrees left or right. Four methods implement these effects: 
-(IBAction)Rotate90DegreesLeft;
-(IBAction)Rotate90DegreesRight;
-(IBAction)VerticalFlipEffect;
-(IBAction)HorizontalFlipEffect;
These are pretty easy to understand and can simply be copied into your project with no major changes!
