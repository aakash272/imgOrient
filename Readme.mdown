This is an alternate implementation of the project available at github(https://github.com/alexrepty/Paging-Enabled-UIScrollView-With-Previews). Instead of two scroll-views, I've tried it with one scroll-view and used scrollRectToVisible: method to give it a bubble like effect. A multiple table-view based scroll view is still to be implemented...

All feedback is welcome!
